            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I am a front-end web developer. I am a skilled web developer over 3 years experience.I can provide clean code and pixel perfect design. 
            I also make the website more & more interactive with web animations.A responsive design makes your website accessible to all users, 
            regardless of their device. I believe that a well-designed website should not only look visually appealing but also provide a smooth and
            enjoyable interaction with visitors. </p>
